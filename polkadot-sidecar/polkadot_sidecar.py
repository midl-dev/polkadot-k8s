#it is still unclear to me, the second half of the string always begins with 0b, which indicates an integer, however it does not have the two bits  after that indicative for one of the integer formats from the Codec definition.
#Jaco
#0x0b = 0b1011 - 11 (lower 2 bits as per spec) indicates 4 bytes mode, so number of byte following is 4 (as indicated) + 0b10 bytes - so total of 6 bytes.
#nuevax
#I tried all kinds of 6 bytes hex to dec, but to me it seems the 10/13 digit dec timestamp cannot be generated out of 6 bytes even though it says compact.

#0x280402000bb1f14e327201 this is the string from the extrinsic, 0bb1f14e327201 the second half, after 0b none of the codec specifications.
